# Dog Api Lab

This project was a project I built during my time at Redwood Code Academy. I built a fully funtional dog breed picture searching app. The way it works is you type a dog breed name in the search box and you'll get back a randomized set of dog images of that breed. App was built using React using an axios call to the Dog Api.  Super fun because who doesn't like dogs. :dog:

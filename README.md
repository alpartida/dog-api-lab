# Dog Api Lab

This project was a project I built during my time at Redwood Code Academy. I built a fully funtional dog breed picture searching app. The way it works is you type a dog breed name in the search box and you'll get back a randomized set of dog images of that breed. App was built using React using an axios call to the Dog Api.  Super fun because who doesn't like dogs. :dog:

## Netlify  

After completion of this web app, I delpoyed the code to Netlify. See the live site by clicking on this link https://pensive-gates-015856.netlify.app/

### npm install
Installs the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

### npm run start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
